/// does today) makes every derived seed depend on the exact order and count of every earlier
/// derivation - reordering two <c>AddNode</c> calls, or adding an unrelated derivation in between,
/// silently reseeds every node that comes after it. <see cref="GetSiteSeed(SimulationSeedDomain, string)"/>
/// instead hashes <c>(SimulationSeed, domain, stableId)</c> directly: the result depends only on the
/// domain and the caller-supplied stable identity (e.g. a node's network address), not on when or
/// how many times it - or any other id - was derived. This is "stable per-node/per-site
/// derivation" as required by the design: renaming, reordering, or adding unrelated nodes never
