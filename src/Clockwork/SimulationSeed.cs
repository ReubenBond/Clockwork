/// Instead, the seed is derived by SHA-256 hashing the UTF-8 bytes of the input and interpreting

/// <see cref="Clockwork.Runtime.Random.SimulationSeedAuthority"/>'s per-domain derivation, so
/// "derive a stable seed from a string" has exactly one implementation across the codebase).
/// SHA-256 is a fixed, versioned algorithm with no process- or platform-specific behavior, and
/// UTF-8 encoding is likewise fixed and unambiguous, so the same string always produces the same
/// seed on any machine, any .NET version, and any run - including across separate processes and
/// separate machines, which is what "cross-process-safe" means here. The result can be negative:
