/// <c>timedOut: false</c> (an auto-reset handle consumes exactly one signal, in FIFO order); when the
/// virtual-time deadline elapses it fires with <c>timedOut: true</c>. A registration created with
/// <c>executeOnlyOnce: true</c> fires once; otherwise it re-arms until <see cref="Unregister(WaitHandle)"/>
/// cancels it. The safe factory flows the caller's <see cref="ExecutionContext"/> to the callback; the unsafe
