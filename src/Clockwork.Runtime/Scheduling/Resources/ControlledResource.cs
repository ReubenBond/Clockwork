/// policy. A monitor's mutual exclusion, a semaphore's permit counting, an event's manual/auto reset,
/// and a task wait's external completion are all composed on top of these fields by the scheduler and
/// its callers; a primitive that needs behaviour these fields cannot express attaches it via
