/// <summary>
/// An optional observer of <see cref="ControlledOperation"/> lifecycle transitions within a
/// <see cref="ControlledOperationScheduler"/>. The scheduler invokes the listener exactly once per
/// applied state transition, in the deterministic order those transitions occur - transitions are
/// serialized with their publication, so external cancellation and signaling cannot publish a later
/// state before an earlier transition. A listener never observes two notifications concurrently, and
/// the sequence it sees is a stable function of the scheduling decisions made.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Notifications are delivered <em>after</em> the transition has been applied and <em>outside</em>
/// the scheduler's internal lock, so a listener may safely read the operation's public state and
/// even call back into the scheduler (e.g. to resume another operation). A listener must not throw:
/// an exception from a listener is a diagnostics bug and would corrupt the scheduling sequence.
