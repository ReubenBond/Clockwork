/// Marks a type that <see cref="Rewriting.RewriteEngine"/> must never rewrite. The engine skips the
/// whole type, including the compiler-generated types nested in it (async and iterator state machines,
/// lambda and local-function closures), transitively, and records each skip as an explicit exclusion in
/// the instrumentation manifest rather than silently ignoring it. An explicitly declared nested type keeps
/// its own annotation. A callback the type hands to simulated code - a lambda or local function - is
/// therefore not rewritten either and runs uncontrolled, with real time, real timers, and the thread pool.
