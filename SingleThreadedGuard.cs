/// <para>
/// By default the guard's notion of "who is inside" is the physical
/// <see cref="Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId"/>. When the simulation is driven by the
/// controlled-operation kernel (see <c>ControlledOperationScheduler</c>), one logical simulation
/// thread is carried by several physical threads over its lifetime - the controlling thread plus a
/// dedicated thread per operation - even though the permission baton guarantees only one of them
/// ever executes at a time. Supplying a <paramref name="logicalOwnerProvider"/> lets the guard key
/// on that single logical owner instead, so a legitimate baton handoff is reentrant while genuinely
/// escaped async work (running on an unrelated thread) is still detected. When no provider is
/// supplied the guard behaves exactly as it always has.
